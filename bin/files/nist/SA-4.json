The requirements in the acquisition documents permit updating security controls as new threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new technologies are implemented. Acquisition documents also include requirements for appropriate information system documentation. The documentation addresses user and system administrator guidance and information regarding the implementation of the security controls in the information system. The level of detail required in the documentation is based on the security categorization for the information system. In addition, the required documentation includes security configuration settings and security implementation guidance. FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on configuration requirements for federal information systems."}}}, "references": [{"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf", "#text": "FIPS 140-2"}, {"@href": "http://www.isosecuritysolutions.com/ISOIEC-15408.html", "#text": "ISO/IEC 15408"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-23/sp800-23.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-23"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-35/NIST-SP800-35.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-35"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-36/NIST-SP800-36.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-36"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-64-Rev2/SP800-64-Revision2.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-64"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-70-rev1/sp800-70r1.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-70"}, {"@href": "http://WWW.NIAP-CCEVS.ORG", "#text": "Web Resource WWW.NIAP-CCEVS.ORG"}], "control_enhancements": [{"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization requires in acquisition documents that vendors/contractors provide information describing the functional properties of the security controls to be employed within the information system, information system components, or information system services in sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the controls."}}}}, {"@sequence": "2", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization requires in acquisition documents that vendors/contractors provide information describing the design and implementation details of the security controls to be employed within the information system, information system components, or information system services (including functional interfaces among control components) in sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the controls."}}}}, {"@sequence": "3", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization requires software vendors/manufacturers to demonstrate that their software development processes employ state-of-the-practice software and security engineering methods, quality control processes, and validation techniques to minimize flawed or malformed software."}}}}, {"@sequence": "4", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization ensures that each information system component acquired is explicitly assigned to an information system, and that the owner of the system acknowledges this assignment."}}}}, {"@sequence": "5", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization requires in acquisition documents, that information system components are delivered in a secure, documented configuration, and that the secure configuration is the default configuration for any software reinstalls or upgrades."}}}}, {"@sequence": "6", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization:"}, "ns2:ol": {"ns2:li": ["Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products that composes an NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and", "Ensures that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by the NSA or in accordance with NSA-approved procedures."]}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "COTS IA or IA-enabled information technology products used to protect classified information by cryptographic means, may be required to use NSA-approved key management."}}}}, {"@sequence": "7", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization:"}, "ns2:ol": {"ns2:li": ["Limits the use of commercially provided information technology products to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a validated U.S. Government Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; and", "Requires, if no U.S. Government Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, then the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated."]}}}}]}
