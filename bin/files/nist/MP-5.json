This control also applies to mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices) that are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel use caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems that are transported outside of controlled areas. A controlled area is any area or space for which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system."}, {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "Physical and technical security measures for the protection of digital and non-digital media are commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information residing on the media, and consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Locked containers and cryptography are examples of security measures available to protect digital and non-digital media during transport. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and/or integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. An organizational assessment of risk guides: (i) the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring protection during transport; and (ii) the selection and use of storage containers for transporting non-digital media.
