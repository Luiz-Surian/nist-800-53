Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Additionally, maintaining records of access is essential for ensuring that configuration change control is being implemented as intended and for supporting after-the-fact actions should the organization become aware of an unauthorized change to the information system. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Examples of access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes are implemented into a third-party interface rather than directly into the information system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). Some or all of the enforcement mechanisms and processes necessary to implement this security control are included in other controls. For measures implemented in other controls, this control provides information to be used in the implementation of the other controls to cover specific needs related to enforcing authorizations to make changes to the information system, auditing changes, and retaining and review records of changes. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3."}}}, "references": false, "control_enhancements": [{"@sequence": "1", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization employs automated mechanisms to enforce access restrictions and support auditing of the enforcement actions."}}}}, {"@sequence": "2", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined frequency", "#text": "The organization conducts audits of information system changes [] and when indications so warrant to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred."}}}}, {"@sequence": "3", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined critical software programs", "#text": "The information system prevents the installation of [] that are not signed with a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization."}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "Critical software programs and/or modules include, for example, patches, service packs, and where applicable, device drivers."}}}}, {"@sequence": "4", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined information system components and system-level information", "#text": "The organization enforces a two-person rule for changes to []."}}}}, {"@sequence": "5", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization:"}, "ns2:ol": {"ns2:li": ["Limits information system developer/integrator privileges to change hardware, software, and firmware components and system information directly within a production environment; and", {"ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined frequency", "#text": "Reviews and reevaluates information system developer/integrator privileges []."}]}}}}, {"@sequence": "6", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization limits privileges to change software resident within software libraries (including privileged programs)."}}}}, {"@sequence": "7", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined safeguards and countermeasures", "#text": "The information system automatically implements [] if security functions (or mechanisms) are changed inappropriately."}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system reacts automatically when inappropriate and/or unauthorized modifications have occurred to security functions or mechanisms.
