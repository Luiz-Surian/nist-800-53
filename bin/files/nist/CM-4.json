Individuals conducting security impact analyses have the appropriate skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing information system documentation such as the security plan to understand how specific security controls are implemented within the system and how the changes might affect the controls. Security impact analysis may also include an assessment of risk to understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analysis is scaled in accordance with the security categorization of the information system.
