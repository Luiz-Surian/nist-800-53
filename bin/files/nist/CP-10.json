Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning the information system to its original functional state before contingency plan activation. Recovery and reconstitution procedures are based on organizational priorities, established recovery point/time and reconstitution objectives, and appropriate metrics. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim information system capability that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes an assessment of the fully restored information system capability, a potential system reauthorization and the necessary activities to prepare the system against another disruption, compromise, or failure. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities employed by the organization can be a combination of automated mechanisms and manual procedures.
