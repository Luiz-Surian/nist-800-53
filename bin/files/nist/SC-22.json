To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). With regard to role separation, DNS servers with an internal role, only process name/address resolution requests from within the organization (i.e., internal clients). DNS servers with an external role only process name/address resolution information requests from clients external to the organization (i.e., on the external networks including the Internet). The set of clients that can access an authoritative DNS server in a particular role is specified by the organization (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists)."}}}, "references": {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-81r1/sp-800-81r1.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-81"}, "control_enhancements": false}
