The organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within the organization and external to the organization. Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with each connection and the appropriate controls employed. If the interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, an Interconnection Security Agreement is not required. Rather, the interface characteristics between the interconnecting information systems are described in the security plans for the respective systems. If the interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials but the authorizing officials are in the same organization, the organization determines whether an Interconnection Security Agreement is required, or alternatively, the interface characteristics between systems are described in the security plans of the respective systems. Instead of developing an Interconnection Security Agreement, organizations may choose to incorporate this information into a formal contract, especially if the interconnection is to be established between a federal agency and a nonfederal (private sector) organization. In every case, documenting the interface characteristics is required, yet the formality and approval process vary considerably even though all accomplish the same fundamental objective of managing the risk being incurred by the interconnection of the information systems. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. Information systems may be identified and authenticated as devices in accordance with IA-3. Related controls: AC-4, IA-3, SC-7, SA-9."}}}, "references": [{"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips199/FIPS-PUB-199-final.pdf", "#text": "FIPS Publication 199"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-47/sp800-47.pdf", "#text": "NIST Special Publication 800-47"}], "control_enhancements": [{"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization prohibits the direct connection of an unclassified, national security system to an external network."}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "An external network is a network that is not controlled by the organization (e.g., the Internet).
