Configuration change control for the information system involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, test/evaluation, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to components of the information system, changes to the configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers), emergency changes, and changes to remediate flaws. A typical organizational process for managing configuration changes to the information system includes, for example, a chartered Configuration Control Board that approves proposed changes to the system. Auditing of changes refers to changes in activity before and after a change is made to the information system and the auditing activities required to implement the change.
