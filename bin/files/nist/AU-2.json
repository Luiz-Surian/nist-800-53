To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are to be audited at a given point in time. For example, the organization may determine that the information system must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the extreme burden on system performance. In addition, audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems.
