Vulnerability analysis for custom software and applications may require additional, more specialized techniques and approaches (e.g., web-based application scanners, source code reviews, source code analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for specific functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices and for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow mechanisms. The organization considers using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are also excellent sources for vulnerability information. In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises are another source of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Related controls: CA-2, CM-6, RA-3, SI-2."}}}, "references": [{"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-115/SP800-115.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-115"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-40-Ver2/SP800-40v2.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-40"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-70-rev1/sp800-70r1.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-70"}, {"@href": "http://CWE.MITRE.ORG", "#text": "Web Resource CWE.MITRE.ORG"}, {"@href": "http://NVD.NIST.GOV", "#text": "Web Resource NVD.NIST.GOV"}], "control_enhancements": [{"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned."}}}}, {"@sequence": "2", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined frequency", "#text": "The organization updates the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned [] or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported."}}}}, {"@sequence": "3", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can demonstrate the breadth and depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked)."}}}}, {"@sequence": "4", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization attempts to discern what information about the information system is discoverable by adversaries."}}}}, {"@sequence": "5", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-identified information system components", "#text": "The organization includes privileged access authorization to [] for selected vulnerability scanning activities to facilitate more thorough scanning."}}}}, {"@sequence": "6", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities."}}}}, {"@sequence": "7", "baseline-impact": "HIGH", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined frequency", "#text": "The organization employs automated mechanisms [] to detect the presence of unauthorized software on organizational information systems and notify designated organizational officials."}}}}, {"@sequence": "8", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization reviews historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in the information system has been previously exploited."}}}}, {"@sequence": "9", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to:"}, "ns2:ol": {"ns2:li": ["Conduct a vulnerability analysis on the information system; and", "Perform penetration testing on the information system based on the vulnerability analysis to determine the exploitability of identified vulnerabilities."]}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "A standard method for penetration testing includes: (i) pre-test analysis based on full knowledge of the target information system; (ii) pre-test identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pre-test analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.
