Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode) or contained within a compressed file. Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, diskettes, or compact disks. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code attacks. Pervasive configuration management and strong software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions and business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms are not built to detect such code. In these situations, organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to include, for example, secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration management and control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than those intended.
