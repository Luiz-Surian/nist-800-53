The term labeling is used when referring to the application or use of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within the information system (see AC-16, Security Attributes). Removable information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media requiring marking. Marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. Some organizations, however, may require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. Organizations may extend the scope of this control to include information system output devices containing organizational information, including, for example, monitors and printers. Marking of removable media and information system output is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance."}}}, "references": {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips199/FIPS-PUB-199-final.pdf", "#text": "FIPS Publication 199"}, "control_enhancements": false}
