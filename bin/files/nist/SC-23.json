The intent of this control is to establish grounds for confidence at each end of a communications session in the ongoing identity of the other party and in the validity of the information being transmitted. For example, this control addresses man-in-the-middle attacks including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. This control is only implemented where deemed necessary by the organization (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services)."}}}, "references": [{"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-52/SP800-52.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-52"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-77/sp800-77.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-77"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-95/SP800-95.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-95"}], "control_enhancements": [{"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination."}}}}, {"@sequence": "2", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system provides a readily observable logout capability whenever authentication is used to gain access to web pages."}}}}, {"@sequence": "3", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session and recognizes only session identifiers that are system-generated."}}}}, {"@sequence": "4", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined randomness requirements", "#text": "The information system generates unique session identifiers with []."}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "Employing the concept of randomness in the generation of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force attacks to determine future session identifiers."}}}}]}
