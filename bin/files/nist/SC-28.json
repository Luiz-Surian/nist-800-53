Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Configurations and/or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and filtering routers and authenticator content are examples of system information likely requiring protection. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate."}}}, "references": [{"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-111/SP800-111.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-111"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-56A/SP800-56A_Revision1_Mar08-2007.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-56"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57-Part1-revised2_Mar08-2007.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-57"}], "control_enhancements": {"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of information at rest unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures."}}}}}
