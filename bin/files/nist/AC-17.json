For example, while the organization may deem it appropriate to use a system interconnection agreement to authorize a given remote access, such agreements are not required by this control. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless (see AC-18 for wireless access). A virtual private network when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, is considered an internal network (i.e., the organization establishes a network connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on external networks to protect the confidentiality or integrity of information transmitted across the network). Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web servers or systems specifically designed for public access. Enforcing access restrictions associated with remote connections is accomplished by control AC-3.
