Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). Many information system components are shipped with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a significant security risk, and therefore, are changed upon installation. The requirement to protect user authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of users and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within the information system (e.g., passwords stored in a hashed or encrypted format, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible only with super user privileges). The information system supports user authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during verification stage of biometric authentication. Measures to safeguard user authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, PL-4, PS-6."}}}, "references": [{"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201-1/FIPS-201-1-chng1.pdf", "#text": "FIPS 201"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-63"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-73-3/sp800-73-3_PART1_piv-card-applic-namespace-date-model-rep.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-73"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-76-1/SP800-76-1_012407.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-76"}, {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-78-2/sp800-78-2.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-78"}, {"@href": "http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf", "#text": "OMB Memorandum 04-04"}], "control_enhancements": [{"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system, for password-based authentication:"}, "ns2:ol": {"ns2:li": [{"ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type", "#text": "Enforces minimum password complexity of [];"}, {"ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined number of changed characters", "#text": "Enforces at least a [] when new passwords are created;"}, "Encrypts passwords in storage and in transmission;", {"ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum", "#text": "Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of []; and"}, {"ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined number", "#text": "Prohibits password reuse for [] generations."}]}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "This control enhancement is intended primarily for environments where passwords are used as a single factor to authenticate users, or in a similar manner along with one or more additional authenticators.
