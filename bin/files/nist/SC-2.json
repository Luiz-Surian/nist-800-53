The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical and is accomplished by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods as appropriate. An example of this type of separation is observed in web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. This may include isolating the administrative interface on a different domain and with additional access controls."}}}, "references": false, "control_enhancements": {"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system prevents the presentation of information system management-related functionality at an interface for general (i.e., non-privileged) users."}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The intent of this control enhancement is to ensure that administration options are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information).
