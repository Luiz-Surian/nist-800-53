Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14. Unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) may need to be considered for detailed accountability of activity. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local or network. Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained by direct connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which involves communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are under the control of the organization. For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is considered an internal network if the organization establishes the VPN connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on any external networks across which the VPN transits to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification and authentication requirements for information system access by other than organizational users are described in IA-8."}, {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The identification and authentication requirements in this control are satisfied by complying with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with organization-specific implementation plans provided to OMB.
