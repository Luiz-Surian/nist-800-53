This control enhancement helps mitigate this risk by requiring that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus, limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Reducing the risk of audit compromises by privileged users can also be achieved, for example, by performing audit activity on a separate information system or by using storage media that cannot be modified (e.g., write-once recording devices)."}}}}]}
