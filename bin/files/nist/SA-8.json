For legacy information systems, the organization applies security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of the hardware, software, and firmware within the system. Examples of security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring system developers and integrators are trained on how to develop secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs; and (vii) reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions."}}}, "references": {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27A/SP800-27-RevA.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-27"}, "control_enhancements": false}
