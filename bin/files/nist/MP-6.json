While scanning such devices is always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that the device is free of all malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider sanitization of portable, removable storage devices, for example, when such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when the organization loses a positive chain of custody for the device.
