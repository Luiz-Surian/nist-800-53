This control also applies to mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices). Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel use extreme caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems. A controlled area is any area or space for which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections are sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system."}, {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring physical protection. Fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls to the facility where the media resides provide adequate protection."}, {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "As part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting information at rest on selected secondary storage devices.
