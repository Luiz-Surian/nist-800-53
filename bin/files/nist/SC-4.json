Control of information in shared resources is also referred to as object reuse. This control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been in some way nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels where shared resources are manipulated to achieve a violation of information flow restrictions; or (iii) components in the information system for which there is only a single user/role."}}}, "references": false, "control_enhancements": {"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system does not share resources that are used to interface with systems operating at different security levels."}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "Shared resources include, for example, memory, input/output queues, and network interface cards."}}}}}
