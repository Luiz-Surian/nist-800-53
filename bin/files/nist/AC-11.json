The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. This is typically at the operating system-level, but may be at the application-level. A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the information system, for example, if the organization requires users to log out at the end of the workday."}}}, "references": {"@href": "http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2006/m06-16.pdf", "#text": "OMB Memorandum 06-16"}, "control_enhancements": {"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The information system session lock mechanism, when activated on a device with a display screen, places a publicly viewable pattern onto the associated display, hiding what was previously visible on the screen."}}}}}
