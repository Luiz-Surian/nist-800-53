In addition, the organization considers the location of physical entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be in close proximity to the information system and therefore, increase the potential for unauthorized access to organizational communications (e.g., through the use of wireless sniffers or microphones). This control, to include any enhancements specified, may be satisfied by similar requirements fulfilled by another organizational entity other than the information security program.
