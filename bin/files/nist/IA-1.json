Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The identification and authentication policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Identification and authentication procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the identification and authentication policy.
