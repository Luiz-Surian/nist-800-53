Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising from the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationship between the organization and the external provider. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk. The external information system services documentation includes government, service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified instance of noncompliance."}}}, "references": {"@href": "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-35/NIST-SP800-35.pdf", "#text": "NIST 800-35"}, "control_enhancements": {"@sequence": "1", "description": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "The organization:"}, "ns2:ol": {"ns2:li": ["Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services; and", {"ns2:em": "Assignment: organization-defined senior organizational official", "#text": "Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is approved by []."}]}}}, "supplemental-guidance": {"ns2:div": {"ns2:p": {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as firewalls, or key management services."}}}}}
