External information systems include, but are not limited to: (i) personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of the organization. For some external systems, in particular those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies, the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. In effect, the information systems of these organizations would not be considered external. These situations typically occur when, for example, there is some pre-existing sharing or trust agreement (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies and/or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system and over which the organization has the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. The restrictions that an organization imposes on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions are likely to vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Thus, an organization might impose more stringent security restrictions on a contractor than on a state, local, or tribal government."}, {"@class": "align_left", "#text": "This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems and information (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov).
