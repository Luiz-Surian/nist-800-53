External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system (e.g., within internal organizational networks and system components). Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, at selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The Einstein network monitoring device from the Department of Homeland Security is an example of a system monitoring device. The granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to support such activities. An example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization with regard to monitoring is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses organizational HTTP proxies, when use of such proxies is required.
